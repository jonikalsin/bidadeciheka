Samantha is the girlfriend of one of the key cast members Gus Smyrnios, and fans have already heard her voice when Gus talked to her on the phone.

Some parts of the long post are as follows:</span></p><p><span>“This is my girlfriend Sami…we’ve been together going on 9 months now. Had just started going steady when I filmed the new Szn of @floribamashore coming out tomorrow…Also, I’ve wanted to keep the happiness we’ve created between us, without strangers trying to ruin it. I thank you Sami for being so sweet and understanding. You’re a true blessing to me, I love you, and thanks for accepting my craziness.”</span></p><p><span>Based on the information from Instagram, Gus, and his girlfriend, Samantha must have started dating in January 2021. And it seems Gus has finally found someone to settle down with after a long time of Bachelorhood and relationships ruined by his celebrity.</span></p><p><span>For most of Floribama Shore, especially in the early seasons, Gus has been single and yet never had a lack of ladies on his arms. There was a brief period in season three when he was in a serious relationship with fellow cast member Lisa Burns. It was not a very healthy relationship and it ended in a “tearful conversation”.</span></p><h3><b>Samantha Carucci Family</b></h3><p><span>Samantha Carucci was born in a family with Italian roots.
