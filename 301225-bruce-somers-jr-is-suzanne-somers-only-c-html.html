The then-young actress struggled to make ends meet and resorted to fraud, for which she was caught and arrested.</p><p class=dh>Bruce Somers Jr was born in 1965 to Suzanne and Bruce Somers. His parents had married that same year when Suzanne was 19 years old. However, their union didn't last long, as they divorced in 1968.</p><p class=dh>The separation left Suzanne alone as a single mother, and she struggled to stay financially afloat while raising Bruce Jr. Still, she fought to ensure her son felt loved, safe, and cared for, as his touching Instagram tributes to the actress have revealed.</p><p class=dh>Bruce Jr frequently referred to Suzanne as a warrior with a big heart and always raved about her fierce affections. He chose a slightly different career from his mom's and raised his own family for the better part of the last thirty years.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bruce Somers Jr. Grew up in Austerity When Mom Struggled to Make Ends Meet</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Despite <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4828795/how-many-children-does-suzanne-somers-have/>his parents' divorce</a>, Bruce Jr kept his father's name. Following the separation, as his mom struggled to make ends meet, she resorted to the fraudulent act of writing her rent checks before any money reached her account, leading to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://buffalonews.com/news/suzanne-somers-from-breathless-blond-star-to-charming-grandmother/article_2f5cfab2-38da-52bf-8c74-acde4bb083b7.html>her arrest</a>.</p><p class=dh>Tabloids had a field day, releasing the news of her arrest alongside her mugshot. She immediately visited the well-respected reporter, Vernon Scott, to tell him her side of the story, and after it was published, Suzanne received much support from the public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c0c63737b4eabe7d4210f4d94eedd3fa.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Suzanne Somers is pictured performing her opening nightclub act the Imperial Room on May 4, (unspecified year), in Canada | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>However, that wasn't her last stroke of bad fortune. In 1971, Bruce Jr was involved in a near-fatal <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.southcoasttoday.com/story/entertainment/local/2005/07/24/understanding-suzanne-somers/50383505007/>car accident</a>. Although he survived, he battled recurring nightmares. Suzanne then took him for counseling at a community health center, where they paid $1 a visit.</p><p class=dh>A year later, Bruce Jr's counselor was confident he was fine but brought it to Suzanne's attention that she also needed counseling. Describing her as a "walking apology," the counselor told her he'd never met anyone with "such low self-esteem."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bruce Jr. Always Has His Mom's Back & Reassurance</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Bruce Jr. hasn't missed her birthday or a Mother's Day to show his appreciation for Suzanne's acts of love as she raised him. On 2020's Mother's Day, he penned <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CAA-zvVJ6L2/>a touching tribute</a> about her "unwavering love" and encouragement.</p><p class=dh>On <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGa6YH5JMVA/>her birthday</a> that year, in October, Bruce Jr candidly listed her milestones, including surviving an alcoholic father and overcoming cancer. He praised her for using her voice and influence to help others in similar situations. Celebrating her 75th birthday, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVGPY6WpJYm/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"A warrior suffers the slings and arrows so those around them don’t have to. A true warrior doesn’t do this for fame or notoriety, a true warrior does this because they know it’s their calling. Ultimately, a warrior is a teacher who blazes a path first. My mother is a warrior. And as of today she's been blazing those paths for 75 years on this earth."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bruce Somers Jr. Found Happiness with Wife of 31 Years</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Bruce Jr married <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CTindwUnuxm/>his wife</a>, Caroline Somers, sometime in 1991. He celebrated her birthday last month with a heartfelt reflection on everything he appreciated about her, alongside a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmg-iUtrLhd/>stunning photo</a> of the pair dancing the sunset away.</p><p class=dh>The couple has been parents to two daughters, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CjOdDc9voLE/>Camelia</a>, born on October 2, 1995, and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CNLIxx4pL63/>Violet</a>, born on April 2, 1998.
