They were born on March 7, 1990, in Carver County, Minnesota, as dicephalic parapagus twins, which means they have two heads but share one body. They have separate hearts, lungs, spines, and stomachs, but share the lower half of their body.</p><p>The twins have defied the odds and learned to live harmoniously as one. They have graduated from college, obtained their driver’s license, traveled around the world, and worked as elementary school teachers. They have also starred in their own reality TV show, Abby and Brittany, which aired in 2012.</p><p>But what about their love life? Are Brittany and Abby married? Do they date? Do they want to have children?</p><p><strong>Are Brittany and Abby Married?</strong></p><p>One of the most common questions that people have about Brittany and Abby is whether they are married or not. There have been many rumors and speculations about their marital status over the years, especially after a Reddit post in 2020 claimed that the twins had tied the knot with a man.</p><p>The post included photos of the twins wearing a white wedding dress and posing with a man in a suit. The man was also seen wearing a ring on his left hand, while the twins had a ring on their right hand. The post did not provide any details about the identity of the groom or the date and location of the wedding.</p><p>However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Brittany and Abby are married. The photos could have been taken from a photoshoot or a prank. The twins have never confirmed or denied the rumor publicly. According to Tuko.co.ke, the conjoined twins are not yet married. They are hopeful that they will one day find their perfect love story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Do Brittany and Abby Date?</strong></h2><p>Another question that people often wonder about Brittany and Abby is whether they date or not. The twins have expressed an interest in dating, getting married, and even having children in the past. They have also stated that they have different personalities and preferences when it comes to romance.</p><p>In an interview with The Sun in 2016, Brittany said:</p><p>We’ve always wanted to date and we’ve always wanted to get married and we’ve always wanted to have kids.</p><p>Abby added:</p><p>We want to live as normally as possible. We’re not afraid of having a relationship because we know we’re different.</p><p>However, dating is not easy for conjoined twins, as they face many challenges and complications. For instance, how do they share intimacy with their partner? How do they deal with jealousy or disagreement? How do they balance their individual needs and desires with their shared ones?</p><p>The twins have not revealed much about their dating history or current status. They have kept their personal lives private and away from the media spotlight. However, there was a rumor in 2012 that Brittany had gotten engaged to an unnamed man. The rumor was based on a photo of Brittany wearing what appeared to be an engagement ring on her finger.</p><p>The rumor was never confirmed or denied by the twins or their family. It is possible that the ring was just a fashion accessory or a gift from someone. There is no proof that Brittany or Abby has ever been engaged or married to anyone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Do Brittany and Abby Want to Have Children?</strong></h2><p>Another question that people are curious about Brittany and Abby is whether they want to have children or not. The twins have expressed a desire to become mothers someday and raise a family of their own. They have also said that they would love to adopt children if they cannot conceive naturally.</p><p>However, having children is not a simple matter for conjoined twins, as it involves many medical risks and ethical dilemmas. For instance, how would pregnancy affect their health and well-being? How would childbirth work for them? Whose DNA would the child inherit? How would they cope with parenting responsibilities?</p><p>The twins have not disclosed whether they have ever tried to get pregnant or not. They have also not commented on whether they have consulted any doctors or specialists about their fertility options or potential complications. They have only stated that they are open to adoption as an alternative way of having children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Brittany and Abby Hensel are conjoined twins who have inspired many people with their courage and resilience. They have achieved many milestones in their lives, such as education, career, travel, and entertainment. They have also expressed their hopes and dreams of finding love, getting married, and having children.</p><p>However, there is no evidence that Brittany and Abby are married or engaged to anyone at the moment. They have kept their love life private and away from public scrutiny. They have also faced many challenges and difficulties in dating and relationships due to their unique condition.</p><p>The twins have not given up on their quest for happiness and fulfillment. They have said that they are optimistic and hopeful about their future. They have also said that they are grateful for their family, friends, and fans who support them and accept them for who they are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfl7%2BqwNOapbJlkaOxbq3Bm7BmpZGnv6qxw2aroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6tbTEZpqoppqktq%2Bxw2arsKGeqHqtu9WeZKWhlpp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./full-circle-adia-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Full Circle Star Adia On Working With Steven Soderbergh: Exclusive  Hollywood Life">&larr;
