He gained fame through YouTube and has become one of the most recognizable faces in the Hip-Hop/Rap/R&B genre with his unique musical style. He has sold over 70 million records in the United States and won multiple awards, including Grammys. The Weeknd has also pursued entrepreneurial ventures such as collaborations with brands and creating his own personal brand called “XO.” He is one of the highest-paid entertainers in the world and can earn up to $90 million before taxes in a year while touring.</p><h2><span id=The_Weeknds_Early_Life_and_Struggles>The Weeknd’s Early Life and Struggles</span></h2><p>The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, was born on February 16th, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario. Raised by his mother and grandmother after his parents separated, Tesfaye is of Ethiopian heritage. His father was not involved in his life during his childhood, and the two only saw each other once or twice. Growing up, religion played a significant role in Tesfaye’s life, as he frequently attended the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.</p><p>However, despite his religious upbringing, Tesfaye began using drugs at age 11, starting with marijuana and later becoming addicted to harder drugs. He claims to have committed crimes to fund his addiction. Although he attended high school, he dropped out before his final year and did not graduate.</p><h2><span id=The_Weeknds_Rise_to_Fame>The Weeknd’s Rise to Fame</span></h2><p>The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, got his stage name from leaving high school and his family’s house without returning. He ran into a producer named Jeremy Rose, who had been developing the concept of “dark R&B” and saw Tesfaye as a perfect fit for the movement. Rose produced several songs that Tesfaye rapped on, and he uploaded them to YouTube, gaining a significant following and catching the attention of Drake.</p><p>Tesfaye’s first major release was the mixtape House of Balloons, which was a huge success and resulted in Drake approaching him with a plan to collaborate. The two Canadian artists toured together, with The Weeknd opening for Drake. After releasing two more mixtapes, Tesfaye was approached by several major record labels who wanted to sign him.</p><h2><span id=The_Weeknds_Music_Career>The Weeknd’s Music Career</span></h2><p>After touring in 2012, The Weeknd partnered with Republic Records and created his own label, XO. His first album, Kiss Land, debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard top 200. Beauty Behind the Madness, his second album, reached the top spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 and eventually went platinum. He set Guinness World Records in 2017 for Most Streamed Album on Spotify in One Year.

His music is influenced by legends like Michael Jackson and Prince, and his style blends indie and electronic elements with R&B.</p><p>However, The Weeknd’s lyrics are known for exploring heavy emotional themes such as drug use, heartbreak, and loneliness.
