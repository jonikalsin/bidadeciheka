But it has since either sunk into uncertainty or vanished altogether. He appeared to make these videos as a natural extension of his earlier “YouTube Drama” videos while allowing him to reveal more of his relationships with channels that were vital to his childhood. Currently, he has not signed endorsement deals with any brands. However, it is sure that he will surely be endorsing some of the top brands from around the world soon in the future.</p><h2><span id=Quinton_Reviews_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Quinton Reviews – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>Furthermore, there is no information related to his<strong> net worth</strong>. He might like to keep his earnings away from the limelight of the media.</p><h2><span id=Quinton_Reviews_8211_Personal_Life>Quinton Reviews – Personal Life</span></h2><p>Quinton Reviews has kept his personal life private. It seems that he may have been in a relationship in the past but it has not been verified yet. He is currently busy with career development rather than in relationships.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>In late 2018, he entangled in a series of controversies surrounding his recent efforts to express his more polarising political opinions on his channel, and his effort to generate humor through his bold character, compared to other thus mid-profile video makers.</p><p>In one of the YouTube videos Logan Paul’s Thinning Sequel is Terrible, he presented his negative opinion on President Donald’s “The American Dream is Dead” Drumpf for nearly a minute of the video, which numerous viewers insisted did not add or connect to the overall video. This insignificant nonsense becomes a running joke in subsequent videos, where he has cited the speech with Donald “The American dream is dead” Drumpf’s name entirely removed, in an attempt to provoke fury in his more vocal detractors.</p><p>Similarly, his Twitter was also the subject of investigation, with many of his tweets (some of which have been deleted), bringing judgment for his more explicitly political tweets, attaining in solidarity with the LGBT communities on YouTube, and his communicated approval for “BreadTube”; a far-left collaboration of YouTube channels that he has partly accessed through his struggle with neoconservative Ben Shapiro.</p><p>Likewise, at the end of 2018, he made a tweet jokingly “celebrating” the deletion of the Mumkey Jones YouTube channel (Jones had earlier appeared in a podcast and challenged Quinton, calling him a “fat cuck” and the f-slur, alongside various rape jokes). He deleted the tweet after a short period, withdrew firmly from Twitter, talked with EmpLemon on Discord, and finally cleaned his image. Also, there was a rumor that he is gay which he confirmed that he is not.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Quinton Reviews stands tall and is a very good-looking and handsome man. He has an amazing personality and a healthy body. However, details about his body measurements such as weight, <strong>height</strong>, dress size, shoe size, chest-waist-hip measurement, etc. are not available for now. His facial feature is characterized by brown eyes and blonde hair wearing glasses. Always keeping a beard is also his unique facial feature.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Quinton-Reviews-standing-along-with-Garfield-statues.jpg alt="Quinton Reviews" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-14364 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Quinton Reviews standing along with Garfield statues (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Quinton Reviews is less active on social media such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
