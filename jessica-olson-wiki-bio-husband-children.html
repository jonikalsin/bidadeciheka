Together, Jessica Olsson and Dirk Nowitzki have a combined net worth of around $141 million. They live in a luxurious mansion in Dallas, Texas, and have three children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family & Early Life</h2><p>Jessica Olsson was born in December 1980 in Gavle, Sweden. Born to a Swedish father and Kenyan mother, Njeri Waikwa, Jessica embraces her multicultural heritage. Not the only sports fanatic in the family, Jessica has younger twin brothers, Marcus and Martin. The brothers play soccer professionally in the UK and can often be seen donning the national team jersey as well. Little is known about Jessica’s early life and from the look of things, she is not too keen on sharing personal information. While she did graduate from a local high school, her further studies remain a question yet to be answered.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career and Meeting Dirk</h2><p>It is not known at what point Jessica moved to the US. Around the time she met Dirk, Jessica was working as an associate director at a Dallas Art Gallery. The pair met at a charity event for the Sports for Education and Economic Development (SEED) Project that was held in February 2010. As it was held during the All-Star Weekend, the players were out and about. Dirk was tricked into raising his paddle for a Rolando Diaz painting, that saw a massive donation go the other way. Following the event, the pair began dating quickly and have been together ever since. Talking about the initial charm, Dirk revealed,</p><p>“What made her so special? What made me fall in love with her? First of all, she’s got to be attractive. That’s obviously part of it. And I think we just clicked intellectually. She likes art, she likes sports. Her brothers both played soccer, they were professional. She grew up around sports. We both love tennis and we love to travel. We both love kids and family.”</p><p>Following her marriage to the NBA star, she became the president of the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, which is a non-profit organization that supports children’s well-being, health and education around the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Problems with Race and Getting Married</h2><p>Even though the pair started dating around 2010, they were first seen publicly on July 13, 2011, on the red carpet at The ESPYS Awards. Things exploded when Dirk kissed Jessica after winning an award. Following the big revelation, people started pointing out how Jessica was a woman of color. Dirk later revealed that race and color don’t matter in a marriage.</p><p>“Color or race for me never really mattered, and that’s also the beauty of sports. You’re a team. Same with marriage. You’re a team and pulling on the same string. You try to make it work, and chemistry has got to be there. That is just the way I was raised.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Three Weddings</h2><p>When the pair decided to tie the knot in 2012, they held three different ceremonies in Kenya, Germany, and Dallas. Dirk later revealed that his wedding in Keny was something that he would always remember. He recalled that they took his wife and brought out five or six girls and he had to recognize his wife from the group. Fortunately for Dirk, his wife’s cologne came through and he recognized her from the group.</p><p>“I guess it’s one of the traditions. If you get it wrong, you got to pay the parents a goat or something. So I was lucky. I smelled her to find the right one. So, I got lucky there. But that was just an experience that I’ll never forget.”</p><p>In 11 years of marriage, the pair have three lovely children. Their eldest daughter, Malaika, was born in 2013. In 2015, the couple had a son, Max, and a year later their second son, Morris, was born. The pair have decided to keep their kids out of the spotlight and allow them to lead private lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversies</h2><p>Jessica Olsson has not been involved in any public controversies, as she prefers to keep a low profile and avoid the media spotlight. She has been supportive of her husband’s illustrious basketball career, which spanned 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks.
