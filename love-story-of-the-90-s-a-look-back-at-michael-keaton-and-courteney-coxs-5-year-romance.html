It all began in 1989 when Keaton was at the height of his career, with notable films like 'Clean and Sober' and 'Batman' under his belt. While his portrayal of the iconic superhero garnered attention, it was his role as a struggling addict in 'Clean and Sober' that captured the admiration of a young Cox.</p><h2 class=split>A love story unfolds</h2><p>Impressed by Keaton's performance, Cox expressed her desire to meet him, and a mutual friend facilitated their introduction, according to InStyle magazine. This unexpected encounter led to a memorable first date, which took place at Cox's home to avoid the prying eyes of the paparazzi. What was meant to be a casual meeting turned into an engaging conversation that lasted for hours. "We talked for five hours. We talked about our dream homes — the great ones we’d seen and the kind we’d like to build ourselves," she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> in 1995.</p><p>At the time, Keaton was 38 years old and a divorced father to his son, Sean, from his previous marriage to actress Caroline McWilliams. Cox, on the other hand, was a 25-year-old actress still striving to establish herself in the acting industry. Their love grew intensely, and rumors of an impending marriage constantly circulated throughout their five-year relationship. However, Cox has consistently denied that Keaton ever proposed to her.</p><p>After nearly six years together, the couple eventually decided to part ways but remained close friends. Cox admitted that she and Keaton still held love for each other, leaving the possibility of reconciliation open. Cox's mother alluded to the reason behind their split, telling People at the time that they "were always trying to work on themselves. They need to forget that and accept each other the way they are — and just get married.”</p><p>At the time of their break-up, Cox had only had nice things to say about their time together. "It's the most important relationship I've ever had, and I think he's the most wonderful person I've ever met," she told PEOPLE in an interview, with tears in her eyes. "We still love each other."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Life beyond love</h2><p>While Keaton has kept his subsequent love life rather private, he has been in a six-year relationship with his girlfriend Marni Turner. Keaton's protective nature is evident, as he tends to shield her from the public eye. At the 74th Emmy Awards, Keaton surprised many by sharing a public kiss with Turner before accepting his award. Although he generally keeps his relationship out of the media, this momentary display of affection showcased his enduring connection with Turner.</p><p>As for Cox, four years after her breakup with Keaton, she found herself immersed in a tumultuous marriage with actor David Arquette. Arquette's flamboyant and outgoing personality stood in stark contrast to the dynamics of Cox and Keaton's relationship. However, their differences initially drew them together. In 2004, Cox gave birth to their daughter Coco after experiencing difficulties conceiving. Yet, the very disparities that initially attracted them eventually led to their separation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/0ab90917-5df2-4a46-8e4c-39d5dc139107.jpg><p>Arquette acknowledged Cox's role as a nurturing figure in his life, remarking that she was like a mother to him. This dynamic ultimately proved to be unsustainable, and Cox decided against reconciliation. Their divorce was finalized in 2013, but they have remained devoted co-parents to their now-18-year-old daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/44624e60-cd29-4b09-a0ad-67c4208d8e09.jpg><p>Following her divorce, Cox found love with Irish singer/songwriter Johnny McDaid, who is 12 years her junior. The couple got engaged in 2014, but their plans for marriage took a turn five years later. Nevertheless, they chose to stay together, embracing their deep affection for one another, according to Cosmopolitan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e91cd853-d56c-4638-ad13-0cb27e8cb035.jpg><p>Cox and McDaid often express their happiness and admiration for each other in interviews and on social media, with McDaid once declaring to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Us Weekly</a>, "I know that I've never loved like I love this woman."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopJ%2Brsm6%2F06ipsmWfm3q1tMRmcGllo2KubrjOqKJmmpGYuG6t02akopuYlrKtecqemK2nnmKur7CMnKauqqSau6bFjJymsatdanq6scCrZKunnZa7pLE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./phora.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phora Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)">&larr;
