The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>punk princess</a> even announced her latest album,&nbsp;Love Sux, in Nov. 2022, marking her seventh studio album release.

Amid Avril and the “Flames” singer’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breakup</a>, she began to be spotted with yet another musician&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tyga</a>,&nbsp;</strong>recently confirming her romance in photos where they were kissing.

The pair were spotted at Nobu in Malibu, and after the breakup was made public, the “Sk8er Boi” singer was spotted out and about with Tyga while at Paris Fashion Week. The two were spotted at a few of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the same shows,</a> and were even seen holding hands while <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attending a party together</a> in matching black hoodies. The pair confirmed the romance rumors when they were spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sharing a passionate kiss</a> at the Mugler x Hunter Schaefer Party in photos from<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;DailyMail.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/avril-lavigne-relationships-mod-sun-spl-embed.jpg><h2>Avril Lavigne’s Engagement With Mod Sun</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>After the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy-nominated</a> artist fell for her previous husbands, she moved on and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>found love</a> once more with Mod. Avril and the rapper met over two years ago in Jan. 2021 while working in the studio together, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>.&nbsp;At the time of their passionate romance in Feb. 2022, the blonde beauty told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the outlet</a> that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>taking a break</a> from dating when she met Mod. “I knew we had a very strong unstoppable connection from the first week of writing and working together in the studio. Immediately,” she gushed at the time. “He made every day better. It was like I had known him forever. As time went on, things kept getting better, and it felt incredibly natural.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Soon after that, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mod</a> popped the question and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> to Avril in March 2022. The Canada native took to Instagram at the time to announce the celebratory moment. “Oui! Je t’aime pour toujours Dimanche. 27. Mars. 2022,” she captioned the carousel of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>engagement photos</a>. Not only did Mod propose in a romantic way in Paris, France, but he also gave Avril a massive heart-shaped <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>diamond ring</a>!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Sadly, all good things come to an end, and Avril’s reps confirmed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>&nbsp;that the couple had gone their separate ways as of Feb. 21, 2023. Despite this, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>also reported the news that day, however, Mod’s reps were not aware of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the split</a>. “They were&nbsp;together and engaged as of three days ago when he left for tour so if anything has changed that’s news to him,” his reps told the outlet that Tuesday.&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has reached out to both reps to confirm the news, but did not receive an immediate response.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Most recently, on Feb. 28, 2023, Mod took to Instagram to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>express his heartbreak</a> with an emotional caption. “In 1 week my entire life completely changed…I just know there’s a plan for it all. I’ll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken,” his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lengthy caption</a> read on Tuesday. “Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage.” Despite Mod’s somber post, Avril appeared unbothered as <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she attended</a> Paris Fashion Week that same day.</p><h2>Her Second Husband, Chad Kroeger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/avril-lavigne-relationships-Chad-Kroeger-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Eight years prior to Avril’s romance with Mod, she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> to Canadian musician&nbsp;<strong>Chad Kroeger</strong>, 48. Avril’s marriage to Chad is notably her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shortest marriage</a> yet, as they divorced by 2015. Not only is Chad is a singer like his now-ex-wife, but he is also the lead singer of the famous band, Nickelback. After she dated&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a> in 2010, she met the “How You Remind Me” hitmaker and they tied the knot in 2013. Two years later, she took to Instagram to reveal that she and Chad had called it quits, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! Online</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Through not only the marriage, but the music as well, we’ve created many unforgettable moments,” Avril wrote at the time of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their separation</a>. “We are still, and forever will be, the best of friends, and will always care deeply for each other.” She also told&nbsp;PEOPLE&nbsp;in 2019 that they remain, “super close. He’s just always been a cheerleader of mine and always been such a huge fan. He’s in my corner, he’s on my side, and he’s always been really great.” Prior to their split, Avril confirmed their engagement <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Twitter</a>. “I’m so excited to tell you the rumors are true… Chad and I got married yesterday!”, she wrote on July 2, 2013.</p><h2>Avril’s Marriage To Deryck Whibley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/avril-lavigne-relationships-Deryck-Whibley-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Wedding bells rang for the first time for the “When You’re Gone” singer in 2006 when she married <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer&nbsp;<strong>Deryck Whibley</strong></a>, 42. Not only was this her first time getting married, it is also her longest marriage to date, as they didn’t divorce until 2010. Two years into their matrimony, she spoke to&nbsp;OK!&nbsp;magazine, via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, and revealed she didn’t want kids until later in life. “Oh God! I don’t want to have kids for like 10 years,” she quipped, before adding, “I still have a lot to do. I don’t even know if I could handle a dog right now. I’m so not ready. Someday I’ll <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>be a mom</a>, but not until I’m in my 30s.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Avril gushed about her romance to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;in 2011, and admitted she met the Sum 41 founder when she was 17 years old. “I made out with him the first day I met him,” she told the outlet at the time. “He gave me my first shot of Jäger. I had a tie on—it was back in the days of the tie.” Later, Avril revealed via her website that she and Deryck had decided to divorce after four years of marriage. “We have been friends since I was 17, started dating when I was 19, and married when I was 21. I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship,” she penned. Avril and the now 42-year-old notably collaborated on her 2011 album, Goodbye Lullaby, about one year after their divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CvqaKkXaGut7XGp5xmoKWor6K6w2ZsaWtlZYN3ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vicari-swain.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vicari Swain | Fan Arch">&larr;
