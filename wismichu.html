Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Brand_Endorsement>Brand Endorsement</span></h2><p>At present, he is not signed as a brand ambassador for any brands or products. Nevertheless, he will surely be involved in the endorsement of major brands in the coming future.</p><h2><span id=Controversies>Controversies</span></h2><p>He often gets tangled with controversies for his controversial and offensive humor and content.&nbsp;In May 2016, multiple news outlets claimed that the show was incredibly offensive and inappropriate and alleged that he even “Called little girls in the audience whores, and invited them to the stage to suck him off.”</p><p>It was when he was on his “There’s A Wismichu in Me” tour. However, his audience and a video of his own proved this wrong. The fact that He gave almost 200 shows and no such complaint surfaced during any of those helped prove his innocence in this matter.</p><p>Since he started dating Ingrid, YouTuber Daniel Santome Lemus aka Dallas Review allegedly harassed Him and Ingrid. This controversy produced multiple videos by both sides, most known being His own “Así es Dallas Review.” It is a ranting, serious-toned video where he explains everything Daniel has committed behind the scenes and on social networks to harass the couple. As of today, both sides still encounter each other on social media.</p><p>In 2015, YouTube shut down Its&nbsp;channel for several days. It was after people reported and flagged his channel for having “explicit sexual content.” Later, a petition on Change.org amassed over 21,000 online signatures in favor of reinstating the He channel, and it was ultimately restored.</p><h4>After 2015</h4><p>In September 2016, He and fellow YouTuber Auronplay made a prank call to a lumber business, asking for firewood to burn down their school. A lumber company in Andalucia appeared on a news program run by Spain’s Canal Sur a few days later.</p><p>They stated that they had filed a police report about the incident because it had negatively impacted their business. The lumber company complained of receiving a high number of prank calls after He uploaded the prank call video. The company spokesperson said that this “ruined” their business. However, He clarified that it was not the same company that they called in the video.</p><p>Then in September 2016, Álvaro Ojeda Sacaluga filed a police report against He after he jokingly claimed that he was “coming for Alvaro Ojeda” while cocking an airsoft handgun. He jokingly made it seem like he was going to murder Ojeda in his “Pokemania” video.</p><p>It was in a segment mocking a video by Alvaro Ojeda where he called fans of the Pokémon Go app “virgins” while stating they should “stop looking at the phone and go at the beach to masturbate at scantily clad women in there”. Ojeda claimed that this made him fear for his life and physical safety. However, the police dropped the report because they didn’t think it was classified as a threat.</p><p>Later in&nbsp;2017, people reported Him to the police for breaking a bottle over a 21-year-old’s head. It happened during a political debate after a night of drinking. In a YouTube video soon after, He admitted that the incident was true and not just a rumor.</p><h2><span id=Wismichu_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Wismichu – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>Moving on, He has a <strong>net worth</strong> estimation of 1.4 million dollars as of October 2020.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>He is currently in a romantic relationship with <strong>María Rubio Sánchez.&nbsp;</strong>They have been dating each other since 2018 and still going strong.
