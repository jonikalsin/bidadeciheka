They express a shift from fear of the unknown to a deep sense of belonging in the world. They no longer need validation from anyone else and recognize that their story is valuable and worth telling. They acknowledge that their own path is unique and trust in their ability to learn from their experiences, past and present. The singer rejoices in the sense of community and belonging they feel, even as they continually travel to new places. They feel destined to be there, even if fear still exists within them. They go forward boldly, realizing that they too are a part of the world’s great mysteries.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, Satsang speaks of fear, the unknown, and the importance of shedding that fear in order to grow in one’s journey. The singer declares that they will remain true to themselves and their beliefs, serving as a warrior against evil and allowing the lessons of the spirits to guide them. The song presents a message of hope, that each person is worthy and deserving of love and belonging. The singer declares this not only for themselves but for all people, recognizing the pressures and the obstacles that confront each individual on their own path.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline
