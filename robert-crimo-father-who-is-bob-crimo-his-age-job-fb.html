After Bobby’s suspected involvement in the shooting which left 6 people dead, people wanted to learn more about him. Here’s what we know about him as of this writing.</p><p>Below in this article, we will discuss his age, job, and social media reach. Learn about Robert Crimo III’s father.</p><h3><strong>Meet Bob Crimo, Highland Park Shooter Robert Crimo Father</strong></h3><p>Bob Crimo or Robert “Bob” Crimo Jr. is the father of the Highland Park, Illinois shooter. Bobby who also goes by the stage name “Awaken The Rapper” is the middle child born to Bob and <a href=#>Denise Crimo</a>. Bob is a prominent figure in Highland, Park. He is running quite a successful business there and once attempted to run in the office.</p><p>In August 2018, Bob announced on his Facebook, “I just picked up my election packet this morning! I’m putting my bid in to run for mayor of Highland Park 2019! More info soon!”.</p><p>He added more, “I hope to get your support! BOB&nbsp; for HIGHLAND PARK MAYOR 2019, A person for the people“.</p><p>However, people were enraged in his FB comment section. One added, “Yeah – You certainly gave back to the community. Six dead and 30 wounded by the EVIL Son of the Devil you spawned. Where were you when he was growing up? WHERE?? YOU are responsible for what he is now. YOU!! I hope you are PROUD of it”.</p><p>Another added, “He really should have gotten his son some help. The parents have some accountability because they have to have some kind of clue about how their child is and their mental state. He should have paid way more attention that his so-called son would not be a cold-blooded killer. Great way to take charge in your son’s life buddy”.</p><p>At the time of the incident, the suspect was living in an apartment behind a house in Highwood, Illinois, owned by his father Bob.</p><h3><strong>Bob Crimo Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1964, Robert “Bob” Crimo is 58 years old in July 2022.</p><h3><strong>Bob Crimo Job</strong></h3><p>Bob Crimo is the owner of <a href=#>Bob’s Pantry and Deli Inc</a>. As a people person, for him, interpersonal interaction is very important and this business allowed him to have those interactions while providing a unique service to Highland Park and the surrounding communities.</p><p>In addition, Bob added that Highland park provided “a safe, clean and supportive environment for family-oriented businesses to operate”. So, he ended up starting Bob’s Pantry and Deli Inc.</p><p>Back in 2013, he was interviewed by ChicagoTribune. Talking about his business, Bob shared, “The biggest draw to the store is the deli. Fresh meats, cheeses, and garnishes make our custom-made sandwiches a No. 1 seller. We also offer a wide variety of grocery, dairy items, and ice cream novelties”.</p><p>Bob added that his store offered a place not only for great food but great conversation as well in our seating area. He said, “This is a unique facet that you cannot find anywhere else but in a family-run and family-oriented store”.</p><p>Bob also owned the White Hen Pantry in Ravinia for over 18 years before it was bought out by Seven-Eleven in 2007. Then, he was left with no store and no job. In total, he has experience working in the business for 39 years.</p><p>However, Bob deleted his LinkedIn that further obstructs unearthing information regarding his career.</p><h3><strong>Is Bob Crimo On FB And Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Robert “Bob” Crimo is on Facebook (<a href=#>@bob.crimo</a>). You can also find him on Twitter (<a href=#>@CrimoBob</a>).</p><h3><strong>Bob Crimo Parents</strong></h3><p>Bob Crimo was born to his father Robert “Bob” Crimo Sr., son of late Sam and Rose Crimo of Highland Park, Illinois. Bob’s mother is Christine Crimo (nee Caldarelli). Besides Bob, Robert Sr. and Christine also have a daughter named Rosanne (Jeff) Wygodny of Chicago. Rosanne and Jeff are parents to two children; Lila and Jemma Wygodny.</p><p>Sadly, Robert Sr. died on 26 October 2018. He was born on 23 December 1929. He was preceded in death by his brothers Sam “Chubby’ Crimo and Tony Crimo, sister Yolanda Whitehurst, and niece Patty Thompson.</p><p>Meanwhile. Christine died in January 2010 at the age of 72.</p><p>Paul Crimo, Bob’s brother, also spoke to CNN. He said that he saw his nephew Sunday evening sitting on a recliner in the house and looking on his computer. “Everything was as normal,” Paul said.</p><p>Paul Crimo said he had never seen the suspect engage in violence or concerning behavior. He didn’t know of his nephew’s political views, either, describing him as a “quiet” person. Paul added, “He’s usually on his own. He’s a lonely, quiet person. He keeps everything to himself”.</p><p>“I’m so heartbroken for all the families who lost their lives,” Paul Crimo said.</p><h3><strong>Bob Crimo Political Party</strong></h3><p>Back in 2019, Bob Crimo ran for the office of Mayor as a republican.</p><p>In November 2018, he announced again, “It’s OFFICIAL! With great honor and privilege, I’m now OFFICIALLY on the ballot for the 2019 mayoral seat! My chance to give back to the community that is home to me and my family for many generations, it is now my purpose to serve my fellow neighbors!”</p><p>Calling himself “a person for the people,” he was defeated by the city’s current mayor, Nancy Rotering, a Democrat, whose campaign touted the importance of gun control, reported The Independent.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Bob Crimo From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Robert Crimo Jr. and his family are the residents of Highland Park, Illinois for generations.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Bob Crimo Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of this writing.
